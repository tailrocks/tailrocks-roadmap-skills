# Installation

Install the package `tailrocks-roadmap-skills` from the central
`tailrocks` marketplace. The marketplace source is
`tailrocks/tailrocks-skills`. The qualified plugin id is
`tailrocks-roadmap-skills@tailrocks`. Always use the qualified id.
It prevents collisions with same-named plugins.

Each section below names the exact version, surface, and source. Shell
commands run in a terminal. Session commands run inside the agent
session. All commands were recorded on 2026-10-07.

## Runtime requirements

All delivery workflows need Git. Lanes with a pull request need an
authenticated `gh` session with access to the target repository.
Only GitHub.com is supported. GitHub Enterprise is unsupported.
Read-only work can run without authentication.

Vet the package before install. Read `plugin.json`, the host
manifests, and the twelve skill directories under `skills/`. This package ships
skills, references, and assets only. It adds no hooks and no MCP
servers.

## User-only skills

Eleven skills need an explicit human command. A model must not
select them from task similarity. Only `tailrocks-grilling` is
model-selectable. Support differs per client:

- Enforced on Claude Code, Codex, Kimi Code, and Grok Build. The
  client blocks automatic model invocation.
- Limited on Amp, Antigravity, and Muse Code. These clients cannot
  enforce per-skill user-only entry. Invoke the eleven skills only
  through an explicit human command.
- Gated by `permission.skill` on OpenCode V1. Set the value to `ask`
  for the eleven skills.

Loading or selecting a skill never authorizes side effects. Each run
needs its own human invocation.

## Claude Code

- Version and surface: `claude` 2.1.289, CLI. Sources: the plugin
  docs at code.claude.com (five pages, HTTP 200) and local `--help`,
  2026-10-07.
- Tools and access: the `claude` CLI and network access to GitHub.
  Delivery lanes need an authenticated `gh` session.
- Method: native marketplace, then qualified install.
- Scope: user, project, or local.

Shell commands:

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add tailrocks/tailrocks-skills
claude plugin install tailrocks-roadmap-skills@tailrocks --scope user
```

Inspect the install (shell):

```sh
claude plugin list
claude plugin details tailrocks-roadmap-skills
```

Selection example (session):

```text
/tailrocks-roadmap-skills:tailrocks-idea Add offline mode to the CLI
```

Update and reload. Update one plugin (there is no update-all), or
refresh the marketplace listing and its installed plugins (shell).
Reload in the session after changes:

```sh
claude plugin update tailrocks-roadmap-skills@tailrocks
claude plugin marketplace update tailrocks
```

```text
/reload-plugins
```

Removal (shell):

```sh
claude plugin uninstall tailrocks-roadmap-skills --scope user
```

Limits and evidence: removing a marketplace uninstalls its plugins
and strips `enabledPlugins`. Cloud sessions load no local or project
plugins. A project scope needs one install per machine. Sources with
`..` are rejected. Source: the loading and manifest-reference docs,
2026-10-07.

## Codex

- Version and surface: codex-cli 0.160.1, CLI. Sources: the plugin
  guide at developers.openai.com, the developer-commands and
  skills-and-plugins pages at learn.chatgpt.com, and local `--help`,
  2026-10-07.
- Tools and access: the `codex` CLI and network access to GitHub.
- Method: native marketplace, then qualified add.
- Scope: user install under `~/.codex/plugins/`, plus project enable
  in `.codex/config.toml`.

Shell commands:

```sh
codex plugin marketplace add tailrocks/tailrocks-skills
codex plugin add tailrocks-roadmap-skills@tailrocks
```

Inspect the install (shell):

```sh
codex plugin list --available --json
```

Selection example (session):

```text
$tailrocks-idea Add offline mode to the CLI
```

Update and reload (shell). This refreshes the marketplace snapshots
for configured plugins, even disabled ones:

```sh
codex plugin marketplace upgrade tailrocks
```

Removal (shell):

```sh
codex plugin remove tailrocks-roadmap-skills@tailrocks
```

Limits and evidence: Codex 0.160.1 has no `install`, `update`, or
`validate` verbs (local `--help`). Marketplace refresh is separate
from installed-plugin refresh: there is no verb to refresh one
installed plugin. Restart the desktop app after local edits. Whether
`marketplace remove` also removes installed plugins is unresolved in
the docs. Identity is `name@marketplace`: always qualify the id.

## Amp

- Version and surface: docs unversioned, CLI plus hosted threads.
  Sources: the skills, plugins, global-plugins-and-skills, and
  settings pages at ampcode.com, plus the official building-skills
  guide, 2026-10-07. The `amp` CLI is absent locally, so these
  commands are doc-derived and unverified here.
- Tools and access: the `amp` CLI and a local checkout of the
  package. Each skill installs as its own directory.
- Method: per-skill add from local paths.
- Scope: project `.agents/skills/`, machine-local
  `~/.config/agents/skills/`, or personal and workspace hosted
  scopes.

Shell commands. Clone once, then add each of the twelve skill
directories:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tailrocks/tailrocks-roadmap-skills
for skill in tailrocks-idea tailrocks-seed-roadmap \
    tailrocks-brainstorm tailrocks-grilling tailrocks-research \
    tailrocks-record-decision tailrocks-record-feedback \
    tailrocks-finalize tailrocks-plan tailrocks-prove \
    tailrocks-reconcile tailrocks-retrospect; do
  amp skill add ./tailrocks-roadmap-skills/skills/"$skill" \
    --name "$skill"
done
```

Each add copies the full skill directory, including references and
assets. Add `--global` for the machine-local scope. Add
`--overwrite` to replace an older copy.

Inspect the install (shell):

```sh
amp skills list --json
```

Selection example (session). Amp has no slash invoke. Ask the thread
for the exact qualified skill by name:

```text
Use the tailrocks-roadmap-skills:tailrocks-idea skill to capture this idea.
```

Update and reload: run the `reload_skills` tool after changes. No
restart is needed. Hosted update is documented under two names
(`amp skill update` on the Global page, `amp skills update` in
building-skills). Verify the correct verb against the installed CLI
before use.

Removal: delete the installed skill directory, then run the
`reload_skills` tool. There is no documented remove subcommand. Never
delete the loader cache directory.

Limits and evidence: hosted installs cap each repository at 200
skills, 200 files, 10 MiB per file, 25 MiB per skill, text files
only. A binary file blocks that skill from loading. Names keep 64
characters or less and match their directory. Descriptions keep 1024
characters or less. All twelve skills in this package fit these
caps. Names are 28 characters or less. Descriptions are 1024
characters or less. Every payload file is text (observed
2026-10-07). Duplicates resolve first-`name`-wins: a local copy
masks a repository copy, and a personal copy masks a workspace copy.
Amp cannot enforce per-skill user-only entry: it lists every
discovered skill to the model. Remove or disable untrusted skill
sources.

## Muse Code

- Version and surface: CLI 1.4.3, doc examples 1.3.0, Developer
  Preview. Sources: the marketplaces-and-updates and compatibility
  guides at meta-models.github.io, plus local `--help` and read-only
  probes, 2026-10-07.
- Tools and access: the `muse` CLI and network access to GitHub for
  the first snapshot. Installs run offline from the snapshot.
- Method: native marketplace, then qualified install, then approve
  when the client asks.
- Scope: marketplace installs are always user scope. Local-path
  installs accept user or project scope.

Shell commands:

```sh
muse plugins marketplace add tailrocks tailrocks/tailrocks-skills
muse plugins install tailrocks-roadmap-skills@tailrocks
```

This package ships no hooks and no MCP servers, so there is usually
nothing to approve. When the client reports capabilities that wait at
`review_needed`, approve them explicitly.

Inspect the install (shell):

```sh
muse plugins list --json
```

Validate a local checkout without install (shell, read-only):

```sh
muse plugins validate ./tailrocks-roadmap-skills --json
muse skills validate ./tailrocks-roadmap-skills/skills/tailrocks-idea
```

Selection example (session): select the skill in the `/` picker and
invoke its shown slash shortcut:

```text
/tailrocks-idea Add offline mode to the CLI
```

Update and reload (shell). Refresh the catalog first. Installed
plugins never use the refreshed snapshot, so refresh one git
plugin with the remove plus install sequence, then re-approve when
the client asks:

```sh
muse plugins marketplace update tailrocks
muse plugins remove tailrocks-roadmap-skills@tailrocks
muse plugins install tailrocks-roadmap-skills@tailrocks
```

Removal (shell):

```sh
muse plugins remove tailrocks-roadmap-skills@tailrocks
```

Add `--delete-data` to also remove the plugin data directory. The
data directory stays without the flag.

Limits and evidence: the first marketplace add clones over git with a
60 second timeout and stores a snapshot. The catalog probe reads
`marketplace.json`, then the Codex form, then the Claude form.
Removing a marketplace keeps installed plugins working but ends
their git update path. The catalog `name` must equal the manifest
`name` or install fails. Always qualify `@marketplace`. Muse
documents no frontmatter user-only enforcement, and its skill-recall
observer can surface skills automatically. Invoke the eleven
user-only skills only through an explicit human `/` picker command.

## OpenCode

- Version and surface: V1 and V2 docs, file copy, no install verb.
  Sources: the skills pages at opencode.ai (V1, last updated Oct 6,
  2026) and opencode.ai/v2/docs/skills, full pages, 2026-10-07. The
  `opencode` CLI is absent locally, so these steps are doc-derived
  and unverified here.
- Tools and access: a shell and a local checkout of the package.
- Method: copy complete skill directories, including references and
  assets.
- Scope: project `.opencode/skills/` (plus `.claude/` and `.agents/`
  compatibility directories), or user `~/.config/opencode/skills/`.

Shell commands for the project scope:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tailrocks/tailrocks-roadmap-skills
mkdir -p .opencode/skills
cp -R tailrocks-roadmap-skills/skills/. .opencode/skills/
```

Shell commands for the user scope:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tailrocks/tailrocks-roadmap-skills
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/skills
cp -R tailrocks-roadmap-skills/skills/. ~/.config/opencode/skills/
```

Inspect the install (shell): list the copied directories and confirm
each holds its own `SKILL.md` file:

```sh
ls .opencode/skills/tailrocks-idea/SKILL.md
```

Selection example. V1 uses `skill({name})` in the prompt. V2 uses
the path-derived case-sensitive id with `@` mention or
`skill({id})`. Request the skill by name in the prompt:

```text
Use the tailrocks-idea skill to capture this idea as a DRAFT roadmap item.
```

Update and reload: replace the copied files with the new package
files. There is no reload command. V2 lists permitted skills per
step.

Removal: delete the copied skill directories and drop stale `skills`
array entries from `opencode.json`. There is no documented remove
verb.

Limits and evidence: V1 names use 1 to 64 lowercase hyphenated
characters and match their directory. Descriptions use 1 to 1024
characters. All twelve skills in this package fit: names are 28
characters or less, descriptions are 1024 characters or less
(observed 2026-10-07). Never write V2 keys
(`metadata.opencode/autoinvoke`, `disable-model-invocation`,
`permission.skill`) into V1 instructions: the V1 `permission.skill`
map and the V2 JSONC permissions are different schemas. Keep V1 and
V2 instructions separate. Gate the eleven user-only skills with
`permission.skill` set to `ask` on V1:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "permission": {
    "skill": {
      "tailrocks-idea": "ask",
      "tailrocks-seed-roadmap": "ask",
      "tailrocks-brainstorm": "ask",
      "tailrocks-research": "ask",
      "tailrocks-record-decision": "ask",
      "tailrocks-record-feedback": "ask",
      "tailrocks-finalize": "ask",
      "tailrocks-plan": "ask",
      "tailrocks-prove": "ask",
      "tailrocks-reconcile": "ask",
      "tailrocks-retrospect": "ask"
    }
  }
}
```

Duplicates on V2 resolve later-registered source wins: the project
`.opencode` directory beats the global directory. On V1, names must
be unique. Keep one copy per skill.

## Antigravity

- Version and surface: docs unversioned, surfaces "Antigravity 2.0 /
  CLI / IDE". Sources: the plugins, marketplace, skills, and CLI
  reference pages at antigravity.google, 2026-10-07. The `agy` CLI
  is absent locally, so these commands are doc-derived and
  unverified here.
- Tools and access: the `agy` CLI and a local checkout of the
  package. There is no Git-URL install form.
- Method: local-path plugin install, or native skill-directory copy.
- Scope: workspace `.agents/` directories or global `~/.gemini/`
  directories. The CLI skill paths are `.agents/skills/` in the
  workspace and `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/skills/` globally.

Shell commands for the plugin route. Clone first, then install the
local path:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tailrocks/tailrocks-roadmap-skills
agy plugin install ./tailrocks-roadmap-skills
```

Shell commands for the native skill route:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tailrocks/tailrocks-roadmap-skills
mkdir -p .agents/skills
cp -R tailrocks-roadmap-skills/skills/. .agents/skills/
```

Inspect the install. Shell:

```sh
agy plugin list
```

Session:

```text
/plugin list
```

Selection example (session). The CLI converts each skill to a slash
command:

```text
/tailrocks-idea Add offline mode to the CLI
```

Update and reload: no update, upgrade, refresh, or reload command is
documented. The docs describe only the 2.0 to CLI sync.
Reload-after-edit behavior and collision precedence are undocumented.
Reinstall the local path after upstream changes and verify the
loaded copy.

Removal. Shell:

```sh
agy plugin uninstall tailrocks-roadmap-skills
```

Session:

```text
/plugin uninstall tailrocks-roadmap-skills
```

Uninstall removes files and registry entries. For the native skill
route, delete the copied skill directories.

Limits and evidence: the plugin install accepts a local path only.
There is no public marketplace catalog JSON. The root manifest must
not carry the Antigravity schema. This package carries the portable
Agent Plugins 1.0.0 schema (observed 2026-10-07). Antigravity
frontmatter supports only `name` and `description`, so user-only
entry cannot be enforced here. The agent auto-reads skills. Invoke
the eleven user-only skills only through an explicit human
`/<skill-name>` command. Keep one copy per skill: no precedence is
documented.

## Grok Build

- Version and surface: docs unversioned, CLI plus project files.
  Sources: the skills-plugins-marketplaces and CLI reference pages
  at docs.x.ai, plus the xai-org plugin-marketplace repository,
  2026-10-07. Install syntax is corroborated by ten or more
  consistent third-party READMEs. The `grok` CLI is absent locally,
  so these commands are doc-derived and unverified here.
- Tools and access: the `grok` CLI and network access to GitHub.
- Method: native marketplace, then install with explicit trust.
- Scope: user scope under `~/.grok/`. Project scope needs manual
  placement under `./.grok/plugins` or `./.grok/skills`.

Shell commands:

```sh
grok plugin marketplace add tailrocks/tailrocks-skills
grok plugin install tailrocks-roadmap-skills --trust
```

The `--trust` flag is required. The `@marketplace` qualified form
and the direct `owner/repo` and `./path` source forms come from
third-party evidence only. Compare them with current `grok --help`
at install time before use.

Inspect the install (shell):

```sh
grok inspect --json
```

Selection example (session):

```text
/tailrocks-idea Add offline mode to the CLI
```

Update and reload: the `plugin update` and `marketplace update`
verbs are official, but their semantics come from third-party
sources (bump the sha, regenerate the index). Reload is
third-party-only with no official statement. Verify behavior on the
installed build.

Removal (shell):

```sh
grok plugin uninstall tailrocks-roadmap-skills
```

Removal file effects and name-collision behavior are unresolved.
Verify on the installed build.

Limits and evidence: remote catalog entries need the full 40
character lowercase `sha`. Branches, tags, and short SHAs are
rejected, and the client re-verifies the sha against the cloned
head. The `.grok-plugin/plugin-index.json` file is generated: never
hand-edit it. Grok reads the Claude catalog with zero-config
compatibility. This package sets `disable-model-invocation` to
`true` on the eleven user-only skills. Do not treat
`allowed-tools` metadata as an enforced tool-permission boundary.

## Kimi Code

- Version and surface: docs unversioned, CLI surface with in-session
  commands only. Sources: the plugins and skills pages at kimi.com,
  2026-10-07. The `kimi` CLI is absent locally, so these commands
  are doc-derived and unverified here.
- Tools and access: a Kimi Code session with network access to
  github.com and codeload.github.com.
- Method: in-session plugin manager with a commit-pinned source.
  There is no shell verb.
- Scope: user only. Project-level install is unsupported.

Session commands. Register the central catalog first. Kimi never
auto-discovers the catalog, so the marketplace URL is required:

```text
/plugins marketplace https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tailrocks/tailrocks-skills/c401bb7f8aeb77cc8d0cec0b99ce2ab2e0427f3e/.kimi-plugin/marketplace.json
/plugins install https://github.com/tailrocks/tailrocks-roadmap-skills/commit/98d23280cd562c9298ce13ae40bd0eb73a3e376a
```

The commit pin is the recommended form. The pin above is the current
central-catalog revision of this package (version 0.28.0). Apply
every install, enable, disable, or remove with `/reload` or a new
session.

Inspect the install (session):

```text
/plugins list
/plugins info tailrocks-roadmap-skills
```

Selection example (session):

```text
/skill:tailrocks-idea Add offline mode to the CLI
```

Update and reload: there is no `update` subcommand. The manager UI
offers an update when one is available. Official plugins do not
auto-update. Run `/reload` after each change.

Removal (session):

```text
/plugins remove tailrocks-roadmap-skills
```

Removal deletes the installation record but leaves the managed copy
on disk. Delete the
`$KIMI_CODE_HOME/plugins/managed/tailrocks-roadmap-skills/`
directory to clear it fully. The CLI always runs from that managed
copy: reinstall after upstream changes.

Limits and evidence: fields cap at 32 KB each and 64 KB total
`systemPrompt`. Non-`.md` command files are ignored. Paths stay
confined to the plugin root. Manifest names match
`[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}`. This package name fits (observed
2026-10-07). The `.kimi-plugin/plugin.json` manifest must set
`skills` to `./skills/`. Without it, Kimi reads a root SKILL.md
instead. This package sets it (observed 2026-10-07). Invocation
nesting caps at three levels. Duplicates resolve Project over User
over Extra over Built-in. The eleven user-only skills set
`disableModelInvocation` to `true`: invoke them only with an
explicit `/skill:` command. Audit enabled plugins: a
`sessionStart.skill` injection can bypass the gate.

## Migrate from the old catalog

Older installs used the self-hosted `tailrocks-roadmap-skills`
marketplace, which this restructure removed. Move each install to
the central `tailrocks` marketplace in this order. Uninstall each
plugin per scope. Remove the old marketplace. Add the new
marketplace. Install the plugin. The order prevents duplicates.

Claude Code (shell):

```sh
claude plugin uninstall tailrocks-roadmap-skills --scope user
claude plugin marketplace remove tailrocks-roadmap-skills
claude plugin marketplace add tailrocks/tailrocks-skills
claude plugin install tailrocks-roadmap-skills@tailrocks --scope user
```

Removing a marketplace uninstalls its plugins and strips
`enabledPlugins`, so the explicit uninstall first keeps the record
clean. Repeat the uninstall for `project` and `local` scopes when
used.

Codex (shell):

```sh
codex plugin remove tailrocks-roadmap-skills@tailrocks-roadmap-skills
codex plugin marketplace remove tailrocks-roadmap-skills
codex plugin marketplace add tailrocks/tailrocks-skills
codex plugin add tailrocks-roadmap-skills@tailrocks
```

Muse (shell):

```sh
muse plugins remove tailrocks-roadmap-skills@tailrocks-roadmap-skills
muse plugins marketplace remove tailrocks-roadmap-skills
muse plugins marketplace add tailrocks tailrocks/tailrocks-skills
muse plugins install tailrocks-roadmap-skills@tailrocks
```

Grok (shell):

```sh
grok plugin uninstall tailrocks-roadmap-skills
grok plugin marketplace remove tailrocks-roadmap-skills
grok plugin marketplace add tailrocks/tailrocks-skills
grok plugin install tailrocks-roadmap-skills --trust
```

Kimi (session):

```text
/plugins remove tailrocks-roadmap-skills
/plugins marketplace https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tailrocks/tailrocks-skills/c401bb7f8aeb77cc8d0cec0b99ce2ab2e0427f3e/.kimi-plugin/marketplace.json
/plugins install https://github.com/tailrocks/tailrocks-roadmap-skills/commit/98d23280cd562c9298ce13ae40bd0eb73a3e376a
```

Then run `/reload` and delete the stale managed copy when needed.

Amp: delete the old installed skill directories, add the twelve new
skill directories, and run the `reload_skills` tool. OpenCode and
Antigravity native routes: delete the old copied directories and
copy the new ones. Antigravity plugin route: run `agy plugin
uninstall tailrocks-roadmap-skills`, then install the new local
path.
